# simple shell script to compile and link a nasm program on Linux.
#
# this first compiles the irvine.asm file that has the procedures defined in
# Kip Irvine's book, then it compiles the nasm program source being tested, 
# and then links to create an executable.  
#
# Note:  this re-compiles the along32.asm file every time a program is compiled
# and run.  You can comment the first line below out (starting with nasm) if you
# want to avoid this.  However, it takes almost no time to compile this, so it
# won't speed anything up to speak of.
#
# Note2:  this obviously requires the nasm package for linux, which most
# distributions include.  However, it also needs the 32 bit libraries which 
# are commonly not pre-installed.  You will need to google search for 32 bit
# compatibility libraries for your linux distribution and follow the
# instructions to install them.  Once you have those installed, this should
# compile and create an executable.
#
# if you use the command "asm32 test" you must have a test.asm source file, and
# this will create an executable named "test" and a listing file "test.lst" if
# you want to see the addresses and hex instructions.
